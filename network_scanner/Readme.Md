# ARP Scan Python Script

This Python script allows you to perform an ARP scan to discover devices in a local network. It sends ARP requests to the specified IP range or IP address and receives responses from devices in the network, providing their IP and MAC addresses.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Scapy library (`scapy`)

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can check by running:

   ```
   python3 --version
   ```

2. Install the `scapy` library. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using `pip`:

   ```
   pip install scapy
   ```

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Run the script with the `-t` or `--target` option, followed by the target IP range or IP address. For example:

   ```
   python network_scanner.py -t 192.168.2.0/24
   ```

   or

   ```
   python network_scanner.py -t 192.168.2.0/24
   ```

4. The script will perform the ARP scan and display the IP and MAC addresses of the devices found in the network.
