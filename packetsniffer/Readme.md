**HTTP Packet Sniffer**

The HTTP Packet Sniffer is a Python script that uses the Scapy library to capture and analyze HTTP traffic on a specified network interface. This tool is intended for educational and security assessment purposes, to help network administrators and security professionals understand and monitor HTTP traffic on their network.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

- Scapy: Scapy is a powerful packet manipulation library that enables capturing, forging, and decoding network packets. To install Scapy, run the following command in the terminal:

  ```bash
  pip install scapy
  ```

### Usage

1. Open the Terminal on your macOS.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the "packetsniffer.py" script.

3. Run the script with superuser (root) privileges using `sudo`:

   ```bash
   sudo python3 packetsniffer.py -i <interface>
   ```

   Replace `<interface>` with the name of the network interface you want to sniff packets on (e.g., "eth0", "en0", etc.).

4. The script will start sniffing HTTP packets on the specified interface. When HTTP packets are detected, the script will display the visited URLs and any sensitive information (e.g., usernames, passwords) found in the payload.

### Authorization

Always ensure you have proper authorization before using this tool for security assessments or network analysis. Ethical hacking requires responsible and lawful usage of tools and methodologies. Unauthorized packet sniffing is illegal and unethical.

Please use this tool responsibly and follow ethical guidelines when performing any network analysis or security assessments. Always prioritize the security and privacy of networks and their users.
