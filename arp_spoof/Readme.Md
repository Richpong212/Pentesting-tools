# ARP Spoofing Tool To Spoof all Clients on a Network

This is a simple Python script for performing ARP spoofing to intercept network traffic between a target machine and the gateway. ARP spoofing is often used for network analysis, security testing, or debugging purposes. Before using this script, make sure you have the necessary permissions and authorization to perform such activities on the network.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- scapy library

## Enable IP forwarding

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Install the required libraries by running:
   ```
   pip install scapy
   ```
4. Run the script with root privileges (e.g., using `sudo`) and specify the target IP address and the gateway IP address using the `-t` and `-g` options, respectively:
   ```
   sudo python arp_spoof.py -t <TARGET_IP>/24 -g <GATEWAY_IP>
   ```
   Replace `<TARGET_IP>` and `<GATEWAY_IP>` with the actual IP addresses of the target machine and the gateway.

## Options

- `-t`, `--target`: Specify the IP address or IP range of the target machine. Required.
- `-g`, `--gateway`: Specify the IP address of the gateway. Required.

## Disclaimer

**Please use this tool responsibly and only on networks you own or have proper authorization to perform security testing on. Unauthorized use of this tool can violate privacy and security laws and may have serious legal consequences.**
